    "## What is _dead-lite_?\n\ndead-lite is a blogging/tumblog/content manufacturing device built using [dat](https://datproject.org/) and running on [beaker browser](https://beakerbrowser.com/). Have you used a blog before? Then you get it.\n\nThe key difference, though, is that by running on the dat protocol, dead-lite enables each individual to create their own instance of dead-lite and to publish their own content on their own computer. This means the data lives on your computer and doesn't require any server space.\n\n## I want to use _dead-lite_\n\nCool. You should. To create your own _dead-lite_ instance you can either [follow the instructions here](https://github.com/dumblr/dead-lite) or [fork this site](https://beakerbrowser.com/2017/06/14/forking-websites-on-the-p2p-web.html) and update your info in the settings section.",
